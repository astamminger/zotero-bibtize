# zotero-bibtize

Refurbish exported Zotero-BibTex bibliographies into a more ![latex] friendly representation.

In the current state exporting the contents of a Zotero database to Bibtex
format many special characters are replaced by Zotero internal versions or
escaped before written to the output file. This behavior is exceptionally
annoying if entries contain code which is meant to be processed by ![latex]
(i.e. chemical or mathematical expressions and formulas in the title, etc.).

Since there is not interest by Zotero developers to change this behavior (or
even add a simple switch to produce raw and unescaped output) `zotero-bibtize`
can be used to post-process and remove the escape sequences from the generated 
Zotero output files.

## Example
Bibtex entry generated by Zotero:
```
@article{LangCM2015,
  title = {Lithium {Ion} {Conduction} in {\textbackslash}ce\{{LiTi}2({PO}4)3\} and {Related} {Compounds} {Based} on the \{{NASICON}\} {Structure}: {A} {First}-{Principles} {Study}},
  volume = {27},
  issn = {0897-4756, 1520-5002},
  shorttitle = {Lithium {Ion} {Conduction} in {\textbackslash}ce\{{LiTi}2({PO}4)3\} and {Related} {Compounds} {Based} on the {NASICON} {Structure}},
  url = {http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b01582},
  doi = {10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b01582},
  language = {en},
  number = {14},
  urldate = {2019-02-11},
  journal = {Chem. Mater.},
  author = {Lang, Britta and Ziebarth, Benedikt and Els{\textbackslash}"\{a\}sser, Christian},
  month = jul,
  year = {2015},
  pages = {5040--5048}
}
```

After post-processing the file with `zotero-bibtize`:
```
@article{LangCM2015,
  title = {Lithium Ion Conduction in \ce{LiTi2(PO4)3} and Related Compounds Based on the NASICON Structure: A First-Principles Study},
  volume = {27},
  issn = {0897-4756, 1520-5002},
  shorttitle = {Lithium Ion Conduction in \ce{LiTi2(PO4)3} and Related Compounds Based on the NASICON Structure},
  url = {http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b01582},
  doi = {10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b01582},
  language = {en},
  number = {14},
  urldate = {2019-02-11},
  journal = {Chem. Mater.},
  author = {Lang, Britta and Ziebarth, Benedikt and Els\"{a}sser, Christian},
  month = jul,
